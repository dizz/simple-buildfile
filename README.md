# About

This is just a simple docker file that is built by jenkins. Included is the Jenkinsfile that looks the build via pipeline.

Do note that you need to provide your dockerhub credentials to the Jenkinsfile. This is provided by the credentials plugin. Simply create a username/password entry and use the ID you give as the reference within the Jenkinsfile.
